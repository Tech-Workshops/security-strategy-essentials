Nice job removing that `.env` file!

Notice that the commit has been removed from the pull request and that the file no longer persists in the "files changed" tab. **You may need to refresh your page to see the previous commits disappear.**

However, even though we removed the commit, the historical reference to this commit can still be found if you know the commit id. In a real world situation, you'll need to contact **GitHub Support** to perform the following:

- Run garbage collection on the repository to remove the unreferenced commit(s)
- Invalidate the Git cache

For our situation, we can skip contacting GitHub Support for this example! :smile:

Now that the sensitive information has been removed, let's now approve this contributor's pull request

## Step 9: Approve the pull request
1. Approve this pull request.
