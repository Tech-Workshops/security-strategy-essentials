Nice job removing that .env file!

Notice that the commit has been removed from the pull request and that the file no longer persists in the "files changed" tab.

However, there is still historical reference to this commit if you know the commit id. In a real world situation, you'll need to contact GitHub Support to perform the following:

- Run garbage collection on the repository to remove the unreferenced commits
- Invalidate Git cache from the Network page

We can skip contacting GitHub Support for this example!

Now that the sensitive information has been removed, let's now approve this contributor's pull request
