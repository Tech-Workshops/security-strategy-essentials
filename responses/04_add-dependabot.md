Dependabot creates pull requests to keep your dependencies secure and up-to-date!

### How does Dependabot work?

1. Dependabot scans your repository and checks for updates or insecure requirements
1. If any dependencies are out-of-date, Dependabot opens a pull request to update each one
1. If tests pass, and the updated version looks good, you simply merge the pull request

## Step 5: Install Dependabot

1. Navigate to Dependabot on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/dependabot-preview)
1. Click the "Install it for free" button
1. Follow on-screen instructions to add Dependabot to your GitHub profile
1. When installing Dependabot, choose `Only select repositories` and choose this repository, {{ repoUrl }}
1. On `app.dependabot.com`, under `repos you want to add`, select {{ repoUrl }} and click the `Add selected` button
