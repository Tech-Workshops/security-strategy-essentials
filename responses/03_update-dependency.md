## Update the dependency

Next, we'll go through the GitHub Flow to make some changes. If you aren't sure how to do this, try the [Introduction to GitHub course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) and then come back to give it another try.

> _Note: Before doing this with real world code, make sure that the upgraded package works with your code. Good unit tests and CI (continuous integration) will help you update with confidence._

## Step 4: Updating dependency versions

Now that you know the recommended version, it's time to edit the `package.json` file. You'll upgrade the package to a non-vulnerable version.
