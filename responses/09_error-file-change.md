Uh oh @{{ user.username }}, something went wrong! I wasn't expecting this change. Please go over the instructions again and make sure you've followed them as exactly as you can.

### Hint:
It looks like you've made a commit but there's still something not right about the `.gitignore`. Did you include the `.env` file?

If you would like help troubleshooting, create a post on the [GitHub Community]({{ communityBoard }}) board. You might also want to search for your issue to see if other people have resolved it in the past.
