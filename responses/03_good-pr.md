Great job, @{{ user.username }}, your pull request looks good. Thank you for fixing the vulnerable dependency!

_Note: You might notice that this repository has a `package.json` file, but no `package-lock.json` file. In production code it's a good idea to have both files to avoid conflicts with the the resolving the proper version number of a dependency. For simplicity, we'll use only `package.json`, but GitHub monitors both files in addition to the gamut of supported languages and packages_
