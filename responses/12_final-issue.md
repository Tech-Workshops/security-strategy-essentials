Congratulations @{{ user.username }}, you've completed this course! You can see your published [memory game on GitHub Pages]({{ pagesURL }}) with the updated wolverine image.

When considering the security of your repository, consider the installed applications, like me. Every app installed on your repository has access to some of your data. Even if it is harmless (like me), it is a good idea to periodically check and prune the list of installed apps and integrations on your repositories. Look for things like active use, or permissions giving more access than necessary.

## In summary

We learned how to:

- Enable vulnerable dependency detection for private repositories
- Detect and fix outdated dependencies with security vulnerabilities
- Automate the detection of vulnerable dependencies with Dependabot
- Add a security policy with the a `SECURITY.md` file
- Remove a commit exposing sensitive data in a pull request
- Keep sensitive files out of your repository by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file
- Remove historical commits exposing sensitive data deep in your repository
