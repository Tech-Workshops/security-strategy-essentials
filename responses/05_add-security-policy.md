## Adding a security policy

Just like most repositories have a `README.md` file to provide instructions on how to contribute to the repository, a `SECURITY.md` file highlights security related information and instructions on how to handle security related issues and best practices.

This gives collaborators the important security information they need, but it also documents a place where maintainers can think about how they should deal with security disclosures, updates, and general security practices within this repository.

### What should I include in my security policy?

Just like a `README.md` file, it really depends on your repository and the requirements and workflows. Here are a few common topics that are documented in a security policy:

1. Supported versions
1. How to responsibly report a security vulnerability
1. Security related configuration
1. Known security gaps and future enhancements


## Step 6: Add a SECURITY.md file

1. Navigate to the [Security]({{ repoUrl }}/)
1. Click on Policy located in the left sidebar
1. Click the `Start Setup` button
1. Commit the template security policy to the new branch as selected
1. Create the pull request
